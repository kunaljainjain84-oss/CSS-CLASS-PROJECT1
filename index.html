    <h3>What are animals?</h3>

    <p style="color: brown;font-style:oblique;">Animals are complex multicellular living organisms in the Kingdom Animalia, characterized by their ability to move,
    consume other living things (heterotrophy) for energy, respond to stimuli, and possess eukaryotic cells with a nucleus
    but lacking cell walls, differing from plants and fungi.<br><br> They exist in diverse forms across land, air, and water, from
    microscopic creatures to giant whales, playing vital roles in ecosystems and featuring unique traits like specialized
    tissues (e.g., muscles, nerves) and collagen.</p>
    <h3>Facts about animals</h3>
   <p style="font-style: oblique;">Animals have amazing adaptations, like octopuses with three hearts and blue blood, or flamingos forming "flamboyances,"
while some, like elephants, "hear" through their feet, and sea otters hold hands to stay together while sleeping.<br><br> Crows
hold funerals, butterflies taste with their feet, and male seahorses give birth, showcasing unique survival strategies
across the animal kingdom.<br><br>
<h3>Unique Abilities & Anatomy</h3>
<p style="color: brown;font-style: oblique;">Octopuses: Have three hearts (two for gills, one for the body) and blue blood.<br><br>Elephants: Detect low-frequency sounds and vibrations through their feet.<br><br>
Dolphins: Sleep with only half their brain at a time to stay alert.<br><br>
Frogs: Use their eyeballs to push food down their throat.<br><br>
Butterflies: Taste with their feet.<br><br>
Pistol Shrimp: Can snap their claw so fast it creates a bubble hotter than the sun's</p>
